# My emacs configuration.

Welcome to my emacs configuration.

Feel free to use it, share and improve it if you wish!


## Initial skeletron:

I own the initial configuration from https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure.

Thx to flyingmachine for his work on introducing me emacs with clojure.


## Other config:

a part of the intial minimal config, I have added some other functionality and maybe I will remove also other configuration of the initial skeletron adapting to my needs.
